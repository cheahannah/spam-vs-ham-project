Tools: Python (numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebooks

* Split email data into training and test set, then cleaned data by replacing NaN values and removing line breaks, multiple spaces, and stopwords
* Used a logistic regression classifier to test the accuracy of the model to check if model was classifying the emails as spam or ham
